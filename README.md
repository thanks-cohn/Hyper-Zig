Hyper-Zig is a hypervisor-first Zig 0.14.x RISC-V kernel.

Hyper-Zig exists to explore virtualization from first principles while remaining understandable, inspectable, and educational. Every milestone must build successfully, pass validation, and demonstrate a real capability before the next layer is added.

The goal is not to produce impressive claims.

The goal is to produce verifiable progress.

## What Hyper-Zig Is

Hyper-Zig is a hypervisor research project focused on:

* Zig 0.14.x
* Explicit architecture
* Validation-first development
* Educational clarity
* Incremental virtualization milestones

Every completed milestone must be observable and testable.

No milestone is considered complete because code exists.

A milestone is complete only when it can be demonstrated.

---

## Development Ladder

HV0
Status Layer

Produces accurate hypervisor status information and validation output.

HV1
Capability Discovery

Reports host capabilities and exposes hypervisor feature visibility.

HV2
VM/vCPU Objects

Introduces the foundational structures required for virtual machines and virtual CPUs.

HV3
vCPU Lifecycle

Implements typed boot vCPU lifecycle state management: created, initialized, runnable, halted, and reset back to created.

HV4
Guest Memory Object

Defines and validates a PMM-backed guest-memory ownership object for VM 0. This is metadata and ownership only: no guest payload, no guest entry, and no second-stage translation.

HV5
Guest Address Space

Defines and validates metadata-only guest physical address space lookup for VM 0. GPA `0x0` maps to the first configured HV4 guest-memory page and GPA `0x1000` maps to the second configured page. Out-of-range and misaligned page lookups are rejected. This is not guest execution, not second-stage translation, and not a guest payload loader.

HV6
Guest Image Loader Research

Loads a tiny static `tiny-flat-v0` payload into PMM-backed HV4 guest memory through HV5 guest physical address-space metadata, then verifies the bytes by reading them back and comparing byte count plus checksum. This is not guest execution, not Linux loading, not guest entry, and not second-stage translation.

HV7
Guest Entry Research

Future research toward guest entry mechanics without claiming Linux boot until Linux-specific loading and boot are separately implemented and smoke-proven.

HV8
Linux Guest Research

Future investigation and implementation of Linux guest boot support.

HV8+
Advanced Virtualization

Future milestones including isolation, device virtualization, and higher-level guest support.

---

## Current Reality

Hyper-Zig is not yet a complete hypervisor.

Current scope is intentionally narrow: Hyper-Zig can report HV0 status, HV1 capability information, HV2 VM/vCPU objects, HV3 vCPU lifecycle state, HV4 guest-memory ownership metadata, HV5 guest physical address-space metadata, and HV6 tiny flat guest-image loading if validation passes. Guest memory exists as PMM-backed pages owned by VM 0. HV5 address-space lookup validates guest physical addresses and returns backing PMM page metadata for configured pages. HV6 writes a small static `tiny-flat-v0` byte payload into GPA `0x0` and verifies it by readback; it does not execute that payload. Guest execution is still missing. Linux guests are still missing. Guest entry is still missing. Second-stage translation is still missing. The next milestone is HV7 guest entry research.


What is proven:

* Status reporting
* Validation infrastructure
* Capability reporting
* VM object creation
* vCPU object creation
* vCPU lifecycle state transitions when HV3 validation passes
* Guest-memory ownership allocation/free/reset and rejection behavior when HV4 validation passes
* Guest physical address metadata lookup and rejection behavior when HV5 validation passes
* Tiny `tiny-flat-v0` guest payload loading and readback verification when HV6 validation passes

What is not yet proven:

* Guest execution
* Linux boot
* Guest entry
* Second-stage translation
* Hardware-assisted virtualization

This repository intentionally distinguishes between completed work and future goals.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:thanks-cohn/Hyper-Zig.git
cd Hyper-Zig
```

Build:

```bash
zig build
```

Validate:

```bash
export ZIG=/home/big-bro/dev/zig-zag/.tools/zig-x86_64-linux-0.14.1/zig
export PATH=/home/big-bro/dev/zig-zag/.tools/zig-x86_64-linux-0.14.1:$PATH
git status
git branch --show-current
zig version
./scripts/check-zig-version.sh
zig build
zig build hyperzig-status
./smoke/smoke-hv-status-v0.sh
./smoke/smoke-hv-capability-v0.sh
./smoke/smoke-hv-vm-vcpu-v0.sh
./smoke/smoke-hv-vcpu-lifecycle-v0.sh
./smoke/smoke-hv-guest-memory-v0.sh
./smoke/smoke-hv-address-space-v0.sh
./smoke/smoke-hv-guest-image-v0.sh
./scripts/validate-hyperzig.sh
zig build validate-hyperzig
tail -n 240 logs/latest/validate-hyperzig.log
```

If validation passes, the repository is considered healthy.

## Philosophy

Hyper-Zig follows a simple rule:

Build the smallest thing that can be proven.

Validate it.

Document it.

Then move forward.

The project values clarity over cleverness, evidence over assumptions, and demonstrated capability over marketing claims.

Every milestone should teach something useful about how virtualization actually works.

---

## Long-Term Vision

The long-term objective is a fully documented hypervisor stack written in Zig.

Future research areas include:

* Linux guest support
* Rust workloads on guests
* WASM guest environments
* Educational virtualization tooling
* Security and isolation research
* Multi-guest execution

These remain goals rather than claims.

The repository advances only when each capability is proven.

---

## Zig Version Policy

Hyper-Zig targets Zig 0.14.x exclusively.

New contributions should maintain compatibility with Zig 0.14.x unless the repository policy changes.
